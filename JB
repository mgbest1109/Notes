Once a contact has entered the journey, all the data in your entry source DE for that contact will be saved in journey data.

If you look at any decision split, you will see two options

Journey Data : Point in Time data when the contact enters the journey (it never changes)
Lives in system memory, so it is faster to access than Contact Data
Contact Data: A system of Record - always has the most up-to-date value
You can always update the records and fields in the entry source DE, but to get the most up-to-date value, 
you need to link the entry source DE to the contact record under an attribute group in contact builder, Data Designer.

Steps to do this.

Go to Contact builder -> Data designer
Create an attribute group
Link your Entry Source DE to Contact record by creating one to one mapping between the Contact Key on 
the left side to the Subscriber Key in your DE on the right side.
Give 10 to 15 minutes, so that this mapping will reflect in the decision split in journey builder
Now, go to your journey, click on decision split, select contact data, 
select the attribute group you have created, select the entry source DE, select the relevant field to make your decision. 
This field will now give you the latest value which is updated by your automation.
