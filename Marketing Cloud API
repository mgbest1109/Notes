The REST API exposes broader access to Marketing Cloud capabilities.
The SOAP API provides comprehensive access to most email functionality.

the APIs don't have full parity, and you may need to use both SOAP and REST to accomplish your business goals.


REST API
The REST API uses JSON request and response bodies and resource endpoints to support multi-channel use. All new Marketing Cloud technologies implement REST API. REST calls are synchronous, with timeout values of 120 for non-tracking operations and 300 seconds for tracking and data retrieve operations. The maximum payload of any call is four megabytes.

Use the REST API for this functionality:

Contacts
Content Builder
Journey Builder
Mobile Connect
MobilePush
Campaigns
Triggered Sends (may also use SOAP)
Web Services SOAP API
The SOAP API uses SOAP envelopes to pass information between you and Marketing Cloud. We recommend a limit of no more than 2k per minute for SOAP calls. Support may request your SOAP envelope to troubleshoot issues.

Use the SOAP API for this functionality:

Tracking
Subscribers and lists
Automations
Triggered sends (may also use REST)
Content
Most other email activities
