Most of the developer select SOAP API because it is easy to deploy in third party legacy system by using WSDL.
You don't need to write code to authenticate with exact target. You only need to leverage fixed methods present in wsdl file.

SOAP API called in backend of the code and in front end you get the language in which you are best. 
Example if someone want to integrate .net system with Exactarget. 
They can code in c# to call SOAP API. 
Similarly you can code in Apex to call SOAP methods. 
You don't need to write logic/code to authenticate or perform some specific operation with Exactarget. 
SAOP already has methods for all supported base operations. You can build your logic over it.
